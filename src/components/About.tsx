          I’m an Associate Software Engineer with experience building modern web applications using
          JavaScript and TypeScript. I primarily work with React, which I use professionally, and I
          also have experience with Angular and Vue, allowing me to adapt easily to different
          frameworks and project needs.

        <span>
          I’ve worked on the backend using Node.js, Express, and NestJS, along with experience in
          ASP.NET, giving me a solid understanding of how front-end and back-end systems integrate.
          I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and paying attention to details that improve
          performance, stability, and overall user experience.

          In addition to application development, I have hands-on experience with cloud
          infrastructure and deployment through managing a self-hosted server using Coolify. This
          includes deploying applications, handling environments, and maintaining services in a
          production-like setup. I’m a detail-oriented and adaptable developer who enjoys learning,
          problem-solving, and collaborating with others, and I’m currently focused on growing as a
          front-end–leaning engineer while strengthening my full-stack and infrastructure knowledge.
